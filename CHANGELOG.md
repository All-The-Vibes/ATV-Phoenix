All notable changes to ATV-Phoenix are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-09

First shippable release. A self-healing harness for AI coding agents, multi-host (GitHub Copilot + Microsoft Scout).

### Added
- **Self-healing spine** (`phoenix` Rust lib): objective `sense` (command-exit / file-sha256 / regex),
  blessed `snapshot` (only saves a known-good state), bounded `heal` (rollback / retry ≤3, confirmed by
  an external recheck), and a tamper-evident hash-chained `trace` with `verify`.
- **MCP server** (`phoenix-mcp`): stdio JSON-RPC server (rmcp 1.7) exposing `phoenix_sense`,
  `phoenix_snapshot`, `phoenix_heal`, `phoenix_verify_trace` to GitHub Copilot via `/mcp`.
- **CLI mode** (same binary): `phoenix-mcp sense|snapshot|heal|verify-trace '<json>'` with pass/fail exit
  codes — the adapter for hosts without external-MCP support (Microsoft Scout, via its shell tool).
- **Install**: `dist/phoenix.agent.md` + `dist/install.ps1` (Copilot); `dist/scout/` (Scout skill).
- **Evidence**: milestone evals + screenshots (M1–M3, H2) under `evals/`.

### Proven
- M1: behavioral self-heal (`cargo test`, non-tautological — recovery judged by an external signal).
- M2: full sense→heal→verify over real MCP stdio JSON-RPC.
- M3: a live GitHub Copilot session autonomously sensed + healed a fault; file fixed on disk; traced.
- H2: across 20 live Copilot sessions, Phoenix cut the silent-failure rate from 40% to 0% on tasks with
  hidden acceptance criteria, with zero regressions.

### Known limitations
- `command_exit` timeout documented but not yet enforced in-process.
- `tokens_in/out` not yet captured (the host doesn't expose per-call counts to the server).
- `--agent phoenix` requires marketplace/plugin registration; live use today is via MCP-config registration.
- Results are directional (small n, single model, deterministic checkers).
